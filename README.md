Welcome to my Library Management System 2.0 with Database Integration!

There are precisely 6 files in this updated system, but don't let that intimidate you.
The 'Old' Library System is included and preoccupies the file that has said name.
Then we have the SQL database connector (sql_db_connector) that is keeping the connection linked from our MySQL database to the Library Management System.
We need tables created for the users to input the needed data so those tables are in a file entitled 'created_tables'.
The behind-the-scenes fun begins in the file 'merged_lmsystem' where the Classes and functions are integrated with sql functions.
Last but not least, the 'script_for_MergedSystem' is where the functions are executed and come together. 

I hope you enjoy the updated System!
